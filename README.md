# weatherAPI
I'm presenting a little wrapper for [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) that will be used for an upcoming UWP weather app by me, [@itsWindows11](https://github.com/itsWindows11) and [@FireCubeStudios](https://github.com/FireCubeStudios) :)


TODO:

- [ ] add support for american measurments (Fahrenheit, MPH etc)
